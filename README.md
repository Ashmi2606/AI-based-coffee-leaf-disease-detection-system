# AI-based-coffee-leaf-disease-detection-system


## Overview

The AI-Based Leaf Disease Detection System is an innovative project designed to revolutionize agriculture by enabling early and accurate detection of coffee leaf diseases. The system utilizes advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques to identify and classify diseases such as **Phoma**, **Cercospora**, **Leaf Rust**, and **Healthy** leaves. Achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 97.8%, the system ensures early intervention, minimizing crop damage and promoting healthier yields. Additionally, the project integrates Arduino-based sensors, including soil moisture and temperature sensors, as well as an automatic fertilizer sprayer, creating a comprehensive solution for smart farming practices.

## Features
- **Disease Detection**:Utilizes deep learning and softmax classifier algorithms to accurately identify coffee leaf diseases.
- **Multiple Disease Types**: Detects and classifies diseases into three main categories: Phoma, Cercospora, and Leaf Rust.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves an accuracy rate of 97.8%, ensuring reliable disease detection and reducing false positives.
- **Arduino Integration**: Incorporates Arduino-based sensors for soil moisture and temperature monitoring, facilitating precise agricultural management.
